# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Slide decks live in date-prefixed directories such as `25_ESLAB_Leiden/`, each containing a primary `.qmd` file, supporting `images/`, and optional `assets/` overrides. Shared resources sit at the top level: `assets/` for HTML partials, `images/` for cross-talk figures, and `styles.css` for global Reveal.js tweaks. `_quarto.yml` configures the umbrella Quarto site, while `_site/` holds rendered outputâ€”never edit files there. `_template_quarto/` stores starter material when creating a new talk. Utility scripts like `generate_index.py` and `collect_unused_assets.py` automate housekeeping.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `quarto check`: confirm the Quarto CLI and required engines are available.
- `quarto preview`: serve the full site locally with live reload for incremental edits.
- `quarto render <talk>/<talk>.qmd --to revealjs`: build an individual deck into `_site/`.
- `quarto render`: rebuild the entire site after sweeping content changes.
- `python generate_index.py`: refresh the static `index.html` list that complements `index.qmd`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
YAML front matter uses two-space indentation and kebab-case keys; keep metadata blocks compact and alphabetical when practical. Write Markdown with hard wraps at ~100 characters and favor fenced code blocks for math or code chunks. New talk directories should follow the `YY_EventName` pattern and keep file names lowercase with underscores, e.g., `assets/no_footer_on_titleslide.html`. Python utilities follow PEP 8 (4-space indentation, snake_case identifiers) and should include `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards.

## Testing and Git
Testing and commit workflows are handled directly by the repository maintainer.

## Asset Management
Each talk inherits `images/` and `assets/` as symlinks to the shared pools; keep them if you want centralized reuse, or replace the symlink with a real folder when slides demand bespoke art. Run `python collect_unused_assets.py` selectively (it moves orphaned top-level images into `unused_images/`; review before deleting). Store high-resolution figures under `images/` and downsample only within Quarto to preserve flexibility.
